# Astral Kitten Island (Work in Progress)
Astral Kitten Island is an ambitious 2D adventure game project under development. It plans to weave together elements of mystery, magic, and felines in a captivating island setting.

In the vision for this game, players will engage in foraging for resources, vital for upgrading their arsenal of magical spells. As these spells become more potent, they will open the pathway to new areas of the island, inviting players to delve deeper into the game's enigmas.

The heart of Astral Kitten Island lies in a noble mission: rescuing adorable astral kittens dispersed across the island. Each rescued kitten is anticipated to enrich the gameplay by providing unique bonuses and enhancements, contributing to the player's progression.

The game will feature a sprawling, open-world 2D environment filled with diverse biomes, secret routes, and concealed treasures. With the planned mechanics, exploration will be rewarded, curiosity piqued, and every discovery will bring players one step closer to unraveling the island's secrets.

# Current Developments
The game is currently in the early stages of development, and many features are being implemented. Currently, the main focus is on developing an intuitive inventory system to manage resources and spells. This system will play a vital role in managing resources collected from foraging and tracking the player's progress in spell upgrades.

In addition, combat mechanics are also being fleshed out to provide engaging encounters and challenges. The introduction of items, from consumables to powerful artifacts, is another feature on the horizon, designed to diversify the gameplay further and provide more strategic depth.

As Astral Kitten Island grows and evolves, it seeks to provide an unforgettable mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and role-playing elements with its unique blend of magical and feline-themed charm. Stay tuned for exciting updates and milestones in the journey of its development!
